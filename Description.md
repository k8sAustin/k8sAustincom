# Kubernetes Austin: The Cloud Native Hub of the Silicon Hills

**Kubernetes Austin** is the official CNCF chapter serving the Central Texas technology corridor. We are a community of practitioners—from Individual Contributors, Engineers, and Architects to CTOs and CEOs at the region’s largest engineering hubs—dedicated to the advancement of Cloud Native technologies.

Our mission is to elevate the local ecosystem by hosting **production-grade technical talks**. We welcome speakers from all backgrounds, provided they bring engineering depth rather than sales pitches. Whether you are a global CNCF Maintainer or a local engineer with a "war story" to share, our platform is designed to share actionable knowledge.

## Our Core Values & Operating Principles

### 🛡️ Vendor-Neutral Excellence
We believe in technical integrity. To protect our members' time, we prioritize demo-focused, architectural deep-dives over product pitches. All sessions are **vetted against our technical standards** to ensure they provide high-value, transferable knowledge.

### 🔓 Open Access, High Standards
We are committed to keeping our meetups **FREE** and open to all. We believe "Tier 1" content should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget.

### 🤝 Community Mentorship
We believe in the democratized *growth* of speakers. We don't just accept expert speakers; we build them. Our **content review process** is designed to help local engineers refine their proposals into world-class presentations through constructive feedback.
