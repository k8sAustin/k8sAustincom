# Kubernetes Austin: The Cloud Native Hub of the Silicon Hills

**Kubernetes Austin** is the official CNCF chapter serving the Central Texas technology corridor. We are a community of practitioners—from Individual Contributors, Engineers, and Architects to CTOs and CEOs at the region’s largest engineering hubs—dedicated to the advancement of Cloud Native technologies.

Whether you are navigating complex, multi-cluster architectures at an enterprise scale, or you are an engineer looking to deepen your foundational cloud-native expertise, this is your community. We are here to trade architectural war stories, solve hard production problems, and grow together in a friendly, inclusive environment. Join us to ask tough questions, share what you are building, and connect with peers.

Our mission is to elevate the local ecosystem by hosting **production-grade technical talks**. We welcome speakers from all backgrounds, provided they bring engineering depth rather than sales pitches. Whether you are a global CNCF Maintainer or a local engineer with a "war story" to share, our platform is designed to share actionable knowledge.

## Our Core Values & Operating Principles

### 🛡️ Vendor-Neutral Excellence

We believe in technical integrity. To protect our members' time, we prioritize demo-focused, architectural deep-dives over product pitches. All sessions are **vetted against our technical standards** to ensure they provide high-value, transferable knowledge.

### 🔓 Open Access, High Standards

We are committed to keeping our meetups **FREE** and open to all. We believe "Tier 1" content should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget.

### 🌱 Community Mentorship

We believe in the democratized *growth* of speakers. We don't just accept expert speakers; we build them. Our **content review process** is designed to help local engineers refine their proposals into world-class presentations through constructive feedback.

### 🤝 Transparent & Accessible Sponsorship
We believe in an open ecosystem where startups and tech giants alike can support the community. To ensure we do not price out smaller innovators or open-source vendors, financial sponsorships are strictly at-cost to cover venue and food. Furthermore, any organization that donates space, resources, or high-quality speakers is automatically recognized as an official sponsor.

### 🏛️ Democratized Operations, Governed Content
We believe that all Kubernetes meetups should be rooted in the spirit of open source. While our **Program Committee** strictly governs session selection to maintain Tier 1 technical standards, our broader organizational operations are fully democratized. Anyone in the Cloud Native community who wants to help shape the meetup, assist with event operations, or source sponsors is welcome to join.

## 📜 Code of Conduct
Kubernetes Austin is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. As an official chapter, we strictly adhere to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). We expect all organizers, speakers, sponsors, and attendees to help us create a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all skill levels.
